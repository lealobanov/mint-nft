This transaction is used to mint an NFT from the account that has the minting resource saved to it. You are able to give other users minting rights, check out the Admin Minting example for that.

In this case you are defining who is the person that will be receiving the NFT and checking if they actually have the capability to store the NFT in their collection before moving forward. As well as borrowing the Minting resource to mint new NFTS that should be in the account that has the minter saved.

At the end you are executing the transaction and minting the NFT.
