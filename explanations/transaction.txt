This transaction is designed to mint an NFT using the minting resource stored in a specified account. It begins by identifying the recipient of the NFT and verifying that their account has the necessary capability to store NFTs in their collection. Once confirmed, the transaction borrows the minting resource from the account that holds it and uses it to mint a new NFT. The minted NFT is then deposited into the recipient's collection. This ensures that only accounts with the proper setup can receive NFTs and that minting operations are securely executed.

For granting minting rights to other accounts, refer to the Admin Minting example.
